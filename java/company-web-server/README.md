# Company Web Server

Jetty company web server to manage departments, employees, and sales

## Setup

1. Ensure the [Mapepire Server](https://mapepire-ibmi.github.io/guides/sysadmin) is installed and running on the IBM i.

2. Create the `SAMPLE` schema on the IBM i:

    ```sql
    QSYS.CREATE_SQL_SAMPLE('sample')
    ```

3. Clone the repository and build the application:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Mapepire-IBMi/samples.git
    cd java/company-web-server
    mvn clean package
    ```

4. Start the company web server:

    ```sh
    cd target
    java -jar company-web-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

5. Start a web server to launch the Swagger UI:

    ```sh
    npm install -g http-server
    cd swagger
    http-server --cors
    ```

6. Access the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8080 in the browser.
